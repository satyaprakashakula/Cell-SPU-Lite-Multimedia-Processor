# Cell-SPU-Lite-Multimedia-Processor

• Developed dual-issue 11-stage pipelined multimedia SIMD(single instruction, multiple data) processor in
SystemVerilog
• Created and tested the System Verilog model of the processing core, which includes fetch, decode modules, data
forwarding circuits, two pipes with multiple pipelined processing units, and local memory
• Implemented hazard detection and mitigation techniques, addressing data, control, and structural hazards
• Devised an assembly parser to compile Cell SPU assembly instructions to binary
